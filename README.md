# SustainABLE Planning

This will be an app where users can go to feel empowered against climate change issues by sharing ideas and getting ideas for every individual to do something about it, and location-based. There will be opportunities for users to submit suggested activities and ways to save the environment.

The user will log in and see their dash board. They will be able to see the ideas from others they've liked and the ideas they've shared. They will also be able to see their friends. They will then be able to go to a new page to see an index of locations/ideas. After clicking into a page for one idea, they can share comments.

When they post an idea/location, it's categorized and the date is shown, author, and their location.
